# GymPoint-Backend

GymPoint is a small application for a gym manager app.

The application has tools such as:
- Express
- Sucrase + Nodemon
- Eslint + Prettier + EditorConfig
- Sequelize with PostgreSQL
- Password Hash with BcrypJS
- JWT Authentication
- Validation of input data with Yup

In this application, the admin user is the only user who can authenticate to register and change student data.
To register students we need data such as name, email, age, height and weight.
